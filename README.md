By leveraging the power of IoT and ML, EcoSort aims to transform the way we handle and sort waste, making the process not only automated but also intelligent.EcoSort integrates IoT devices and sensors into waste bins, enabling real-time monitoring
of waste levels and conditions. These sensors detect the type of waste being disposed of, ensuring that the waste is categorized correctly. Moreover, the IoT technology allows remote monitoring,
ensuring timely collection and optimizing the routes of waste collection vehicles, thereby reducing fuel consumption and minimizing the carbon footprint.

EcoSort envisions a future where waste management is intelligent, efficient, and environmentally responsible. By harnessing the capabilities of IoT and ML, this innovative system promises to revolutionize the way societies approach waste segregation.

# Problem Statement:
Waste management is a growing challenge in urban areas, characterized by inefficient waste collection processes, environmental pollution, and the need for sustainable resource management. Traditional waste collection methods rely on fixed schedules, which often lead to inefficient resource allocation. Ineffective waste segregation, which is critical for recycling and reducing landfill waste, results in higher operational costs and environmental contamination. Overflowing bins pose health and safety risks, and illegal dumping is a persistent issue in many regions. To address these problems, a smart waste segregation model using Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) can be implemented effectively.

# Aim & Objectives 

The aim of the project is to develop an innovative waste segregation system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to automate the process of waste classification. By utilizing an Arducam OV7670 camera for image input and a VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification, the system aims to accurately categorize waste into nine predefined categories. This project seeks to address the pressing issue of inefficient waste management by providing a cost-effective and scalable solution that can be deployed in various environments, such as households, communities, and commercial establishments. Ultimately, the goal is to promote sustainable practices by streamlining the waste segregation process, reducing contamination, and facilitating the recycling and proper disposal of waste materials.

## Analysis Of VGG19 Algorithm 
The VGG19 algorithm, known for its depth and simplicity, is well-suited for the project due to its strong performance in image recognition tasks. With 19 layers, including 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers, VGG19 offers a deep architecture capable of capturing intricate features within waste images, essential for accurate classification. Its architecture comprises small convolutional filters (3x3) stacked one after another, allowing the model to learn complex patterns effectively. Additionally, the use of max-pooling layers aids in spatial reduction while preserving important features. Moreover, VGG19's pre-trained weights on large-scale image datasets like ImageNet provide a valuable starting point for transfer learning, enabling fine-tuning on the waste classification task with relatively small datasets. This reduces the need for extensive data collection and training time while still achieving high classification accuracy. However, VGG19's depth comes with computational costs, requiring significant computational resources for training and inference. Thus, optimization techniques may be necessary to ensure real-time performance on resource-constrained devices like the microcontroller used in the project. Overall, VGG19 offers a powerful framework for waste classification, balancing depth, simplicity, and transfer learning capabilities.
